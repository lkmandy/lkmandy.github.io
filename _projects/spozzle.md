Spozzle is a slide puzzle that enables users to:

- Pick their preferred puzzle theme and switch between themes as they wish, through a 3D image slider without losing their current score.

- Track their game duration through a timer that persists the score of a user while they switch between themes.

- Pause the game and quickly attend to some pressing issue beyond their control, like opening the door for a guest.

- Listen to African based tunes before the start of the game and while switching between themes.

- Select their language of preference (English or French)

- Experience aspects of the African culture that they can relate to through the Flutter mascot - Dash

- Interact with the game through multiple platforms (android, ios, web and desktop)

- Invite friends to play the game by sharing their scores through WhatsApp, Twitter or Facebook
