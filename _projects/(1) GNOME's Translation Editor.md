## GNOME's Translation Editor

I added two features to this project - the [Translation Editor](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gtranslator), to enable users to:
1. Upload translation files and 
2. Reserve translation modules directly from the Translation Editor (TE). 

I achieved this by integrating TE with [Damned Lies](https://l10n.gnome.org/), following GNOMEâ€™s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG). 

Also, I collaborated with senior developers within the GNOME community to design and build a REST API using Python/Django which was used for the integration. I used the GTK library for the user interface and C to implement the overall logic. I used other libraries like libhandy, libsoup and glib. Lastly, I wrote a help guide, two blog posts and published them on [GNOME planet](https://planet.gnome.org/). Here are my [Contributions](https://gitlab.gnome.org/users/lkmandy/activity)
