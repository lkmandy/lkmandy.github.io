<!-- # **About** -->

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:

I'm a Software Engineer who is highly passionate about building communities through education and technology. I'm invested in lifelong learning and I'm super stoked about contributing to open-source projects. I have contributed to organizations like Muzima, Git and most recently GNOME.

My long-term goal is to use Dart/Flutter to build applications, that solve pertinent problems in under developed countries. I also look forward to becoming a Google Developer Expert in Flutter.

I'm based at the foot of Mount Cameroon, in a small town called Buea. 
I occasionally blog about my contributions to GNOME, my experiences in tech and other fun stuff. Feel free to reach out on any of my social media platforms, if you are interested in connecting further.


<!-- Since 2016, I have contributed to the growth of the tech ecosystem in Buea, Cameroon as a Co-organizer at [Google Developers Group](https://developers.google.com/community/gdg) and a [Women Techmakers](https://www.womentechmakers.com) Ambassador. I began as a volunteer, and a year later, I took up these leadership roles. I raised female membership from 15 to over 220 members. Also, I organized over [15 major events](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Buea/events/past/) like Google I/O Extended, DevFest, International Women’s Day and Study jams. At the end of 2017, I was featured among the [50 Most Influential Young Cameroonians](https://www.camerbeaute.com/career/39r7ssshldnss5wltyg8mkph62shkf) by Avance in recognition of my contributions.

In 2018, I obtained a Bachelor of Technology degree in Software Engineering. I am dedicated to lifelong learning, as a result, I hold a Nanodegree in [Android Basics](https://graduation.udacity.com/nd803) among many other mini certifications. I seize every opportunity I get to learn new skills and equally improve on my current skills sets.

Immediately after graduation (November 2018), I got my first job as an operations manager at a tech startup. After 1 year and 3 months, I decided to focus on programming full time, so I quit this job and began polishing up my skills sets.

After 3 months, I began contributing to two open source organizations; GNOME and Git. In 2020, I became an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) intern at the [GNOME](https://foundation.gnome.org) foundation. I added two features to GNOME’s Translation Editor to enable users to upload translation files and reserve translation modules directly from the Translation Editor. You can take a look at my [contributions ](https://gitlab.gnome.org/users/lkmandy/activity)


I believe education and technology are key tools that can alleviate poverty in Africa and make people live happier lives. As my contribution to this, I mentor students to learn programming or blend technology in their current career path. I put them on a 6 month plan, track their progress and come up with creative strategies to keep them motivated and focused on the goal. I began this initiative in April 2021 and so far, I have impacted the lives of 20 students.
