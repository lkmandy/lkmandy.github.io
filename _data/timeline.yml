  #  description:   I believe education and technology are key tools 
  #                that can alleviate poverty in Africa and make people 
  #                live happier lives. As my contribution to this, 
  #                I mentor students in computer programming and other 
  #                essential digital skills. I put them on a 6 month plan, 
  #                track their progress and come up with creative 
  #                strategies to keep them motivated and focused on 
  #                the goal. I began this initiative in April 2021 and 
  #                so far, I have contributed to the career growth of 20 students.
